\title{Sparse Group Lasso Penalty}
\usage{
sgl_penalty_FGMRM(lambda, alpha, beta, G)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{A non-negative numeric value (tuning parameter) specifying the
strength of the SGL penalty.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between zero and one inclusive specifying the
weight between the lasso penalty and group lasso penalty being applied.
Alpha = 1 gives the lasso fit and alpha = 0 gives the group lasso fit.}

\item{beta}{Regression parameters for each mixture component (group). A
numeric matrix of size G x (p + 1), where the number of rows is equal to the
number of mixture components G, and the number of columns is equal to the
number of covariates p + 1 (for the intercept term).}

\item{G}{An integer greater than or equal to one representing the
number of mixture components in the finite Gaussian mixture regression model.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the SGL penalty for the given model.
}
\description{
Computes sparse group lasso (SGL) penalty for variable selection for finite
Gaussian mixture regression models within iterations of the MM algorithm.
This function is used during model estimation.
